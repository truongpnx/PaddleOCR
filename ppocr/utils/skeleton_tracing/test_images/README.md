The Chinese characters is a quote from a story about a cattle-cutting cook from the book 莊子. The cook described his technique to the King: There're spacings between an ox's skeleton, and being familiar them he can avoid clashing his knife with the bones which would've dulled his knife. (Which is exactly what this algorithm is doing too!). English/Chinese versions of the original story can be read [here](https://ctext.org/zhuangzi/nourishing-the-lord-of-life). The font is Kaiti TC.
